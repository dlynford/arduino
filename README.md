# Temperature data collection using Arduino UNO R3.
This repository holds basic arduino project data that was collected using arduino's basic starter kit. Specifically project 3 of the Projects Book(pg 43), which uses a small temperature sensor (TMP36) to collect ambient temperature data. I began working with this technology at the end of 2021. The goal of this work was to:

1) Familiarize myself with basic IOT (Internet of Things) hardware.

2) Gain experience with arduino's c++ code and proprietary IDE.

3) Gain experience wiring basic cirucity and writing software that complements its circuitry.

4) Generate data over a specified time perod that could be made into CSV files for data analysis.

5) Create pandas dataframes using the temperature(Â°F) data.

6) Finally, graph the data in Juypter notebook.
