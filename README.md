# arduino
This repository holds basic arduino project data that was collected using arduino's basic starter kit. I began working with this technology at the end of 2021.
The goal of this work was to:

1)familiarize myself with basic IOT (Internet of Things) hardware.

2)Gain experience with arduino's c++ code and proprietary IDE.

3)Gain experience wiring basic cirucity and writing software that complements its circuitry.

4)Generate data that could be made into CSV files for data analysis.

5)Create pandas dataframes using the collected data.

6)Finally, graph the data using Juypter notebook.
